            According to the legend, this barangay was unnamed until Blanca (who lived there with her husband Cadio and their two children) and her daughter went to the nearby river to wash their clothes.
            While they went about their task, they heard someone singing. Blanca thought at first that it was Cadio but later changed her mind after listening closely to the voice. Curious,
            they searched for the source of the voice and saw an agta-described to be a supernatural, big, black, and heavy man-singing (canta in the vernacular) while sitting on the lowest branch of the tree.
            He was smoking a tobacco leaf (tabeco in the vernacular). 
            The name of the place today is the combination of canta and tabaco.</p>

            The quiet barrio of Dumlog is situated on the other end of the Hinulawan river.
            It is noted for growing different varieties of bananas. Its name, however, is not culled from this distinct feature.
            <br><br>
            Rather, said the stories, Dumlog was named after the well-loved sport of the locals during the early Spanish era.
            The settlers then were fond of the sport similar to that of wrestling, which was called dunog. Accounts further tell that one day,
            there were Spanish conquistadores passing by the area. When they saw the locals playing dumog, they asked for the name of the place.
            Misunderstanding the question, they answered dumog. Its name today, Dumlog, is a corruption of the term.

            <h1>BARANGAY GENERAL CLIMACO</h1>
            <p><b>General Climaco</b>, malubog was the former name of this barangay and many people continue to call it after its old name. This barangay was named after one of the heroes of the Philippine-American War-General Juan Climaco. General Climaco was the Capitan Mayor or the town mayor of Toledo during the Philippine Revolution. After that, he was designated as the Jefe de Estado Mayor by General Emilio Aguinaldo. When the Philippine-American War broke, he served as one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Forces in Cebu, acting as its Chief of Staff.
            <br><br> Overpowered by the Americans' firepower and tactics, the revolutionaries were forced to make a last stand in the hills of Sudlon. Together with General Arcadio Maxilom, General Climaco led the Cebuano soldiers in a bloody encounter on January 8, 1900 that almost annihilated the local fighters. This led to the surrender of the troops one year later, on October 27, 1901, after which the Americans created a civil government. During the first elections, General Climaco became the first civil governor of Cebu. On his second term, he went to the US and assigned Sergio Osmeña, then the Provincial Fiscal of Cebu, as the acting civil governor. In the next elections, he "gave way" to Osmeña due to poor health. General Climaco passed away on July 16, 1907 at the age of 47.
            <br><br> There are 5,372 residents in this barangay, which has an area of 11.06 square kilometers. The story of the barangay's old name - "Malubog" - began when parents of a child reported that their daughter disappeared while washing clothes in the stream that traversed the area. The stream served as the "lifeblood" of the settlement, which was created way back during the Spanish occupation, providing settlers with water for farming as well as for their own consumption. Upon hearing of the girl's disappearance, the men of the village proceeded to the spot where she was last seen. There they saw that the water has turned muddy or lubog in the vernacular, as if its bottom had been disturbed by the motions of a big creature. Such sight then led to their belief that possibly a huge creature was living at the bottom of the pond.  
             <br><br> To ascertain what was really living underneath the big hole, some men tried to go deeper into the hole and finally they saw a very big fresh water reptile which is known in the vernacular as bris. The people then called their place Malubog, which means "murky," alluding to the murkiness of the river during rainy season.

In the early 20th century, when this place was still part of barangay Tubod, there was once a landed couple that lived there. They were Oyong and Onyang Samper. They grew coconuts in their vast tract of land. The couple had a very unusual way of drying their coconuts. While others used pugon, they laid out the coconut meat on several lantay, which are bedlike structures made of bamboo built for this purpose. Pieces of coconut meat were placed on top of the lantay, which were exposed to the sun for drying.
            <br><br> Because of the presence of the lantay, the locals started to refer to the place as lantayan. When this area eventually became a barangay, the name became Landahan.

Roads and bridges were constructed all over the islands. In Cebu, a road connecting Toledo and Tabunok was one of the projects that was implemented. To complete the road, camps were built along the mountains that were to become part of the road. The camps were named Campo Uno, Campo Dos, Campo Tres, Campo Cuatro, Campo Cinco, Campo Seis, Campo Siete, Campo Ocho, Campo Nueve, Campo Diez, and Campo Once. Campo Once was the last campsite because what was supposed to be Campo Doce was very close to Toledo. 
            <br><br> Campo Once was the last of the campsites constructed on a rolling plain, which is now sitio Bawud of Barangay Magdugo; midway between the last two campsites was Bahada, a gradual slope that ended in Patagan, Media Once is so- called because it is located midway between Campo Diez and Campo Once. The people agreed on the name. Now, the barangay covers 9.2 square kilometers and has a population of 5,377, according to the 2000 census.

            <h1>BARANGAY DAANG-LUNGSOD</h1>
            <p><b>Daang-lungsod</b>, When translated to English, this name means "old town". Technically, though, Daang-lungsod is not a town at present. It is only a barangay, which used to be a part of its neighboring barangay Sangi. Measuring 1.19 square kilometers, it has 2,855 residents. However, in the Spanish era, this relatively small village was once a thriving pueblo or town named Hinulawan. It was to be the beginning of what is now Toledo City. Hinulawan was bounded by the river of the same name.
                 <br> In 1863, a very strong earthquake caused the walls protecting the Hinulawan river from overflowing to break. The earthquake was particularly devastating, causing floods and destroying the town. The residents of Hinulawan left their homes in search of a better place to live in. They settled in an elevated area, and more than a century later, this place is now the City of Toledo.

            <h1>BARANGAY DON ANDRES SORIANO</h1>
            <p><b>Das</b>, The barangay known as DAS is an acronym for Don Andres Soriano. 
                It was formerly called P. del Rosario but people continue to refer to it as "Lutopan."  
                Its name was changed to DAS after the death of Don Andres Soriano, 
                the founder of Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation. 
                The mining company has been operating in the city for more than 50 years and has been instrumental to the city's growth. 
                Though the company suffered financial difficulties especially in the 1990s, 
                Atlas continues to operate its mining and fertilizer companies in the city. 
                The challenges faced by the company have resulted in the contraction of the barangay's population, 
                which saw a decrease by 12.66%, from 21,592 in 1990 to 18,859 in 2000.

            <h1>BARANGAY SANGI</h1>
            <p><b>Sangi</b>, This is one of the smallest barangays in Toledo, with only a land area of 0.82 square kilometer. It is home to 3,553 people. Like many areas in Toledo City, this barangay used to be a quiet and rural area. All things changed when the Atlas Fertilizer Corporation opened there. What used to be a pastorał barangay was transformed into a busy one. In the vernacular, the word sangi mearts "junction point or area of convergence", which is what this place is. 
                At the center of this barangay the three main routes or roads meet one going to Balamban, the other to the Toledo City proper, and the third to Cebu City. One description says: "The highway to Cebu City runs parallel with the Hinulawan river such that at the junction point of the three routes, the other two aforementioned routes branch out rowards the Poblacion and the municipality of Balamban, thus forming a Y-shaped direction." The uniqueness of the place's geography was the reason why Sangi was chosen as its name.

Long before it got its name, Matab-ang was not populated because there was no source of water nearby. Residents had to walk for a kilometer to get water for drinking, bathing, and washing dishes. Fortunato, a fisherman who lived there, called for a meeting together with the other residents of the area. He proposed that they look for a source of water. The body decided to dig a well. However, since the area was near the seashore, many expressed their opposition to the proposal. Fortunato silenced their uncertainties by reciting this verse from the Bible "If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it". A religious person, Fortunato fully believed this, and therefore asked his friends to pray for their success. A well was dug following the prayers, and to their surprise the water was fresh, not salty. 
                Thus, they called the place Matab-ang, meaning "not salty".

            <h1>BARANGAY SAM-ANG</h1>
            <p><b>Sam-Ang</b>, The name Sam-ang is the old Bisaya name for burial ground. Dr. Felix Rodriguez, according to Atty. Cresencio Perolino, found a cave (called "Milagro" by residents) in the barangay where human remains were dug up. Perolino suggests that these are the oldest human remains found in the town of Toledo.
                During the Japanese occupation, this barangay became the hiding place of military and civilians. There were many ipil-ipil trees there (thus it was also called Caipilan then), making it a sanctuary for those who were seeking a safe place to stay. The thick foliage made it hard for the Japanese to spot the men and women in hiding. The place, again, served as burial ground during the World War II. There were 1,553 residents of the barangay as of 2000, according to the census. Its land area is 3.93 square kilometers.
