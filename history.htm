            <h1>HISTORY OF TOLEDO</h1>
            <p><i><b>TOLEDO CITY</b></i>, centrally located on the flat coastal area on the western part of Cebu, is bounded on the west and the northwest by the Tanon Strait, on the east by Cebu City, and on the south by the town of Pinamungahan. 
                <br><br> Its shoreline is regular, but the high waves of the Tanon Strait, 
                <br>along the seashore, makes navigation often dangerous to shipping.
                <br><br> The city has a land area of 174.5 square kilometers, and a population of 300 in 1903, 1,960 in 1918, and 67,727 in 1970. 
                <br> It is the outlet of trading and commercial activities of San Carlos, La Carlota and Cadiz in Negros Occidental, and Bais in Negros Oriental.
                <br> Toledo is connected by first and second class roads from Santander to Daanbantayan, and from Toledo to Cebu City. 
                <br><br> Sugar, rice, and corn are its important agricultural products, while fishing is an important source of livelihood of the people. 
                <br> The old site of Toledo was situated along the banks of the Hinolawan River, a kilometer from the present city area. The people crossed the river, before reaching their settlement; hence, they washed their feet before entering their homes. 
                <br> The place was referred to as a "Waterubg Hole" and the river and the settlement were called "Hinawan" or "Hinolawan" meaning "Washing Place." 
                <br><br>In 1853, the Spanish colonizers moved the Hinolawan settlement to the south of the old site, which proved to be called Toledo, after a city in Spain. 
                <br><br> A year after the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, the natives rose in arms against the Spanish rulers.

            <p>Inspired by Pantaleon Villegas, known as Capitan Leon Kilat, the local revolutionary forces led by Claudio Bacus called Calorio, attacked the Spanish community. 
                <br> The town official, Capitan Esteban Perez, was caught and tried by the revolutionists. 
                <br> He was made to run for his life at Talavera Beach before the rebels bullets hit him. 
                <br> The Spanish curate escaped to Dumanjug and returned with Spanish soldiers who landed at Bato, seven kilometers south of toledo. 
                <br> They attacked the town of Cueva now is known as Capitan Claudio where the revolutionists, after heavy fighting, were pushed back to the caves of Sudlon. 
                <br><br> Later, by order of Governor General Diego De los Rios, the spanish forces were concentrated in the defense of Iloilo. 
                <br> Most of the members of the Spanish community were evacuated from Toledo until the revolutionary army fully controlled the town.
                <br><br> In 1900, when the American forces arrived in the Visayan Islands, they fought against the Filipino forces around the church of Toledo. 
                <br> After the fall of the town, the Americans stormed the general headquarters of the revolutionists at Sudlon.
                <br> The revolutionary government eventually collapsed before the American forces. Under the American regime, schools were opened in 1905 at, Sudlon.
                <br><br> During World War II, Toledo was heavily bombed by the Japanese Air Force and shelled by the Japanese Navy. 
                <br> On March 15, 1942, the enemy forces occupied the poblacion. 
                <br> In April 10 of the same year, the Japanese forces totally controlled Western Cebu.
                <br><br> When the American Liberation Forces re-occupied Cebu, the Japanese burned Toledo before they evacuated to Cebu City. 
                <br><br> <b><i>Toledo became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 2688, approved on June 18, 1960.</i></b>
